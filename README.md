A DIY SCARA (Selective Compliance Assembly Robot Arm) robot is a versatile, compact robotic arm designed for tasks requiring precision, such as assembly, sorting, and pick-and-place operations. As robotics becomes integral to modern industry and education, SCARA robots offer a practical and accessible way to explore automation, robotics programming, and motion control. This project combines affordability with high functionality, making it a valuable tool for learning and small-scale automation.
At the heart of the robot lies the ESP32-C6 WROOM module, a powerful microcontroller equipped with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capabilities, ensuring seamless connectivity and control. The robot's motion is driven by NEMA 17 stepper motors, powered by TMC2209 drivers known for their smooth and efficient operation. Two SG90S servo motors handle the gripper, enabling precise manipulation of objects. The robot’s electronics are powered by a robust power system, featuring an LM2596-5 buck converter to step down a wide input voltage to 5V. This 5V rail is further regulated to 3.3V by an ADP7118AUJZ-3.3 low-noise CMOS LDO from Analog Devices, providing stable power to the ESP32-C6. Analog Devices’s MAX6899 supervisor IC ensures reliable boot-up of the system, while an onboard RGB LED offers visual feedback for status indications. The SCARA robot connects to a computer via a USB Type-C port, leveraging the ESP32-C6's native USB interface for streamlined communication. Control software, written in Python, provides an intuitive interface to operate the robot, featuring functions like direct control and a record-and-playback mode. This functionality allows users to program complex movements by recording and replaying actions with precision. The robot’s firmware is developed using the Arduino IDE, enabling customization and further development by hobbyists and professionals alike.
